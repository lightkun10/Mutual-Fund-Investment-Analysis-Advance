# Mutual-Fund-Investment-Analysis-Advance

## Brief
SEEDS is an Indonesian investment platform startup which currently focused on app-based mutual fund investment at the end of September 2022.

Currently, there are 4 types of mutual funds: 
-	stocks mutual funds 
-	bond mutual funds 
-	money market mutual funds
-	mixed-investment mutual funds.

As our Company is expanding into government bond investment products, the marketing and sales team would like to run a thematic communication campaign for the upcoming product but want to tailor the campaign to a few different relevant segments.

## Business Background
Analyze the data to better understand customer behavior so that we can make better-tailored campaigns to a few different relevant customer segments by using customer clustering methods based on transaction behavior and demographic factors.
