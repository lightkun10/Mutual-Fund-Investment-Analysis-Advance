# Mutual-Fund-Investment-Analysis-Advance

## Brief
SEEDS is an Indonesian investment platform startup which currently focused on app-based mutual fund investment at the end of September 2022.

Currently, there are 4 types of mutual funds: 
-	stocks mutual funds 
-	bond mutual funds 
-	money market mutual funds
-	mixed-investment mutual funds.

In early 2022, Company planned to offer another round of government bond investment. Based on the September bond campaign, the company decided to make further investments and run targeted advertising to existing users back from October 2021.

However, the budget is only enough to serve ads to 30% of the total existing users.
As our Company is expanding into government bond investment products, the marketing and sales team would like to run a thematic communication campaign for the upcoming product but want to tailor the campaign to a few different relevant segments.

## Business Background
Analyze the data to better understand customer behavior so that we can make better-tailored campaigns to a few different relevant customer segments by using customer clustering methods based on transaction behavior and demographic factors.
